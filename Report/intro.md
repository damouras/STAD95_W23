Electricity is an essential requirement for modern society and plays a crucial role in driving societal progress. Over the last few decades, the power industry has undergone a process of deregulation in many countries, with electricity becoming a tradable commodity in the market. With the emergence of this new market structure, there has been an increasing demand for accurate and reliable forecasting methods across various time scales, such as hourly, daily, and long-term. Consequently, the development of such forecasting methods has become a significant research area in the field. On the other hand, energy demand forecast is crucial for electricity storage and cost optimization, and it allows grid operators to plan for and manage the supply of electricity in order to the needs of consumers while ensuring system stability.
