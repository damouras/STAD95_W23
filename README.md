# Data

We collected the hourly electricity price and demand in Ontario from the years 2020 to 2022 (https://www.ieso.ca/en/Power-Data/Data-Directory).We calculated the average of hourly price at a day as our daily price and the sum of hourly demand as our daily demand. Weather data is another feature we used in this project, the data is from https://climate.weather.gc.ca. The average temperature is from the stations in GTA whose postal code started with "M".
